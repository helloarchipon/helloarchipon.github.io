It's not the most exciting of names, but it'll do. It was designed by <a href="http://www.tikari.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tikari Works</a>, a London based studio that has some cool projects on their website (go on, take a look at Pocket House). They seem to have an affinity for sustainability (doesn't everyone at this point, cuz hey, it's in our best interests) and wood.</p><blockquote>The Rye Apartments is a development of 10 sustainable apartments on a highly visible corner site opposite Peckham Rye Park in London. A mix of 1, 2, and 3-bedroom units are set in two blocks that form the termination of an urban block. Through careful analysis of privacy, daylight, and neighbouring building forms the studio developed an architectural language which would complement the surrounding context and history. </blockquote><figure class="image is-2by3 is-clipped"><a class="open-gallery"><img class="lazy lazy--placeholder" src="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-128.webp" data-src="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-640.webp" data-srcset="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-128.webp 128w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-640.webp 640w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-768.webp 768w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1024.webp 1024w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1366.webp 1366w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1600.webp 1600w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1920.webp 1920w" alt="the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9"></a><noscript><a href="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-full.webp"><img src="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-640.webp" srcset="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-128.webp 128w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-640.webp 640w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-768.webp 768w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1024.webp 1024w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1366.webp 1366w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1600.webp 1600w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9-1920.webp 1920w" alt="the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-9"></a></noscript></figure><p>The building itself incorporates a number of eco-based approaches to construction. They've included some passive (natural ventilation) and active (solar panels) strategies to reduce energy consumption. On top of that they've also gone and thrown in a dose of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) for good measure. Apparently the CLT sequesters 227 tons of CO2. Good shit.</p><blockquote>From the outset, sustainable thinking was integrated into the design so that it could be reflected in the quality of the living environment. Emphasis was placed on designing an efficient building with a minimal amount of material, embodied energy, and cost. At the core of this effort for efficiency is the Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) frame that sequesters 227 tons of carbon and is exposed on all walls and ceilings.</blockquote><figure class="image is-2by3 is-clipped"><a class="open-gallery"><img class="lazy lazy--placeholder" src="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-128.webp" data-src="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-640.webp" data-srcset="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-128.webp 128w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-640.webp 640w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-768.webp 768w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1024.webp 1024w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1366.webp 1366w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1600.webp 1600w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1920.webp 1920w" alt="the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17"></a><noscript><a href="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-full.webp"><img src="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-640.webp" srcset="/images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-128.webp 128w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-640.webp 640w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-768.webp 768w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1024.webp 1024w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1366.webp 1366w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1600.webp 1600w, /images/2020/07/02/the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17-1920.webp 1920w" alt="the-rye-apartments-tikari-works-united-kingdom-17"></a></noscript></figure><p>Each unit makes use of a shared kitchen-dining-living room (KDL) and a separate space for the bathroom and bedrooms.
